/cluster/home/xudjian/ModalGNN_Time_Domain/data/dataset_loader.py:190: UserWarning: Creating a tensor from a list of numpy.ndarrays is extremely slow. Please consider converting the list to a single numpy.ndarray with numpy.array() before converting to a tensor. (Triggered internally at ../torch/csrc/utils/tensor_new.cpp:261.)
